## How i validated and Stored Uploaded files?
i validated the uploaded file using filament resources.
i declared the rules in the form schema
the rules are :
<ul>
<li>required can'be null </li>
<li>it must be image </li>
<li>image preveiw is 250 </li>
<li>Max size of the image must not be more then 900kb </li>
</ul>

How i stored
<ul>
 <li>made the disk public to access the files publicly </li>
 <li>used the cover_book directory to store the images </li>
 <li>Only the relative path is stored in the database </li>
</ul>

## How are uploaded files retrieved/displayed?

In Filament, uploaded files are retrieved and displayed by accessing the path stored in the database and then generating a URL using Laravel's Storage system.

Hereâ€™s how i displayed the image:

1. Retrieved the file path from the database 
2. Displaying an uploaded image:
   ```bash
  ImageColumn::make('cover_book')
